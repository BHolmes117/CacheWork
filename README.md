 This code is about creating a cache as how it works in our cache document. This code will simply take user input of how many cache blocks you would want to test the code on.
 The best number to input would be five or six but it is all up the you the user. Once you have inputed your number, you will then have the choice of choosing which  set associativity options you would like to use first. It goes from 1-5 and Direct Mapped, 2-way associative, 4-way associative, and fully associative. Just pick one of then numbers to move to the next step.
 After pick which associative you would like to use, you would press the number one button to use LRU(Least Reently Used) replacement policy. Then after you have done that you would need to input exactly how the example says of put the cache blocks into the brackets. Not doing so it will cause an error or a 100.0% miss rate no matter which associative you pick. I tested that and kept getting that same issue. Doing the example right will guive you the correct Miss rate and the cache content as well. 
 
 This program runs on Java, no JavaFX is needed so no worries there and make sure you have arraylist included in the top along with Scanner, other than that no other issues or attachments is needed to run the program.
